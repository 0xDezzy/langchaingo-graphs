// Package graphs provides interfaces and types for working with graph databases.
//
// This package defines core abstractions for graph data structures including nodes,
// relationships, and graph documents. It provides interfaces for graph stores that
// can persist and query graph data.
//
// The package is designed to work with various graph database backends through
// the GraphStore interface, enabling consistent graph operations across different
// implementations.
